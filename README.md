Multi-threading is a powerful technique that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, which can significantly speed up operations, especially those that are I/O-bound like network requests.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in the multi-threaded code:

1. **Chunking the Data**:
   - Before we start with the threads, we chunk (or divide) the data into smaller subsets. This ensures that each thread handles a specific subset of the data. In the provided code, the list of zip codes is divided into chunks, with each chunk intended to be processed by one thread.

2. **Threaded Function**:
   - This is the function that each thread will execute. It contains the core logic that you want to run in parallel. In the provided code, the `process_zip_codes` function handles a chunk of zip codes, sending requests and processing responses for each zip code in its chunk.

3. **Thread Management with ThreadPoolExecutor**:
   - `ThreadPoolExecutor` is a class provided by the `concurrent.futures` module, which makes it easier to work with threads.
   - It creates a pool of worker threads.
   - With the `executor.map` method, you can easily map a function (in this case, the threaded function) to an iterable (the chunks of data). This means the function will be executed for each item in the iterable, and each execution will be handled by a separate thread from the pool.
   - The results from all threads are collected and processed once all threads are complete.

4. **Max Workers**:
   - This specifies the maximum number of threads that can run simultaneously. It's an important parameter to adjust based on the task at hand and the capabilities of the system you're running the code on. Too many threads can overwhelm the system or the server you're sending requests to. Too few threads, and you might not be utilizing the available resources efficiently.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - In the threaded function, there's a try-except block. This is crucial in multi-threaded applications. If one thread encounters an error and isn't handled correctly, it could potentially crash the entire program. By handling errors within the thread, you ensure that even if one thread fails, others can continue their execution.

6. **Collecting Results**:
   - Once all threads have finished their execution, their results are collected, combined, and processed as needed. In the provided code, results from all threads are combined into a single DataFrame.

In summary, multi-threading is about running multiple tasks concurrently to optimize operations, especially when the tasks are independent of each other, like making separate network requests for different zip codes. The key is to balance the number of threads (not too few, not too many) and handle errors gracefully to ensure the smooth running of the program.
